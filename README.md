## About ML Papers

These are the papers I am using to improve my Machine Learning (and AI too) knowledge day by day. Feel free to check them out. Most of the papers are in preprint state, they might not be complete so keep it that way. These are randomly collected from internet and are randomly arranged in day wise manner. 

## License

The papers are mostly collected from open sources (arXiv.org). If someone finds it restricted, do notify by a pull request. These are for learning purposes, no commercial use of them allowed.

- Indicate the level of difficulty to each paper [NOT DONE YET]
- Indicate the *quality* of each paper e.g. high quality, low quality, technical report, student project, etc. [NOT DONE YET]
- Increase the number of papers in a day from 3 to 10 [NOT DONE YET]
